Universal rules for role-playing games.

Rolecorn is a set of keys for a world that does not yet exist. The mechanics are not strict laws, but guides for your imagination.

There is no single Game Master here. You are all the creators of this world. Roll the dice to set the direction, and your imagination will do the rest. Every failure is a new twist, every victory is a tense triumph.

Remember: these rules are the backdrop for your actions, not their confines. Use them only when you truly need to. Don't be afraid to add your own temporary bonuses for equipment, a clever idea, or great roleplaying. But remember: simplicity is the key to a dynamic game. Don't turn the story into bookkeeping.

## 🎯 WHAT'S INSIDE?

- **CHARACTER ATTRIBUTES** - what are they good at?  
- **SITUATION** - defines the scene's mood  
- **DIFFICULTY** - number determining challenge difficulty  
- **ACTION** - attempt to overcome a challenge  
- **TENSION** - resisting failures  
- **PLOT TWIST** - where will the story turn next?

## GAME MECHANICS  
*Use as needed*

### 1. 📊 **SITUATION**  
*Game Master rolls d4:*

| d4  | Situation    | Effect         |
| --- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1   | 💀 Danger    | +5 to difficulty |
| 2   | ⚡ Complications | +3 to difficulty |
| 3   | 🌀 Neutral   | +0 to difficulty |
| 4   | ✨ Luck      | -3 to difficulty |

**Purpose**: Assess the situation (atmosphere, mood of others, danger of the place, etc.). It is determined once at the beginning of a scene or when the circumstances change dramatically. The modifier remains in effect until the situation changes.

---

### 2. 🎯 **DIFFICULTY**  
*Game Master rolls d20 + situation modifier or opponent's attribute*  
**Example:** d20=15 + Danger(+5) = Difficulty 20

**Purpose**: Determine how difficult the challenge is.

---

### 3. 🎲 **ACTION**  
*Player rolls d20 + attribute*  
**Example:** d20=10 + Strength(+3) + Assistance(+2) = 15

**🤝 Assistance:** another player adds their attribute to the roll

- ✅ **SUCCESS** (roll is greater than or equal to difficulty) — victory!  
- ❌ **FAILURE** — begins **TENSION**

---

### 4. ⏳ **TENSION**  
*The hero has 5 rounds or 5 lives, depending on the situation.
Player rolls d4:*

| d4  | Result       | Difficulty | Rounds |
| --- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| 1   | 💥 Getting Worse | +3        | -3     |
| 2   | 🔥 Hard      | -1        | -2     |
| 3   | ⚔️ Perseverance | -2        | -1     |
| 4   | 🎯 Breakthrough | -3        | -0     |

**DEFEAT:** if rounds are less than or equal to 0 — complete failure

*Improvise! Don't feel constrained by the number of rounds. Shorten them, interrupt them to introduce a new event or action. The main thing is that it's interesting and logical for your story.*

### 💡 EXAMPLE

*"The hero is cracking a safe"*  
1. **Situation:** d4=2 (Complications +3)  
2. **Difficulty:** d20=10 + 3 = 13  
3. **Action:** player rolls 8 + Intellect(+2) = 10 (failure!)  
4. **Tension:** d4=1 — difficulty 16, 2 rounds left  
*"You triggered the alarm! Sirens are blaring, there's little time left"*

---

## 🌀 **PLOT TWIST**
*Use after key scenes to make the story develop unexpectedly*

| d4  | Twist            |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1   | 🔄 Setback/Aggravation       |
| 2   | ⏸️ Dead End      |
| 3   | 🌱 Fork/Clue     |
| 4   | 🎯 Progress      |

## ⚔️ The confrontation of the players

- **Agree on the number of rounds:** Some clashes can be resolved in a single attempt
- **Declare your motives:** Each side states: "I want to..." and "...using (Attribute)"
- 🎲 **Simultaneous roll:** Both sides roll d20 + declared Attribute
- ✅ **Winner (higher roll):** Achieves their goal
- ❌ **Loser (lower roll):** Fails their attempt; if there's more than one round, ⏳ **TENSION** begins
- 🔁 **Each round:** Sum up all your buffs and debuffs from TENSION and add them to your next roll

*Essentially, your opponent's roll sets the difficulty for you, so if you rolled 3 on TENSION (difficulty -2) it means you add +2 to your own roll*

### 🎭 Conflict Example

- **ROUND 1**  
    Warrior: "I'm using a feint to try to knock the sword out of his hands!" (Strength +2). Roll: d20=13 + Strength(+2) = 15
    Rogue: "I dodge and try to slip past to strike him in the back!" (Dexterity +3). Roll: d20=10 + Dexterity(+3) = 13

    The Warrior wins. He describes how his powerful strike forces the Rogue to drop his sword.
    The Rogue rolls for ⏳ **TENSION**: d4=1 (Everything's Worse). He gets a -3 debuff to his next roll.
    *"You're left without a sword, you slip and fall to one knee. You're now in a desperate position (-3)."*

- **ROUND 2**  
    Motives change. The Rogue now wants to "retreat and draw a backup dagger" (Dexterity), while the Warrior wants to "finish him off while he's vulnerable" (Strength).
    On his roll, the Rogue will apply his debuff: d20 + Dexterity - 3.
    After the rolls, the Rogue successfully retreats, and the Warrior, rolling for ⏳ **TENSION** (4), gets a Buff: (difficulty -3 = +3 to roll).
    *"The Warrior missed his strike, but managed to analyze the Rogue's movements."*
