# 🎲 «Rolkorn»

Universal rules for improvisational role-playing games.

Just 4 attributes, 2 types of dice, and a few simple mechanics that turn any outcome into a new plot twist.

You can take turns being the Game Master, collaboratively creating the world and story where every player actively participates in shaping the narrative.

Remember! Rules are tools, not commands. Use them only when you truly need them.

## GAME MECHANICS  
*Use as needed*

### 1. 📊 **SITUATION**  
*Game Master rolls d4:*

| d4  | Situation    | Effect         |
| --- | ------------ | -------------- |
| 1   | 💀 Danger    | +3 to difficulty |
| 2   | ⚡ Complications | +2 to difficulty |
| 3   | 🌀 Neutral   | +0 to difficulty |
| 4   | ✨ Luck      | -3 to difficulty |

**Purpose**: Assess the situation (atmosphere, mood of others, danger of the place, etc.)

---

### 2. 🎯 **DIFFICULTY**  
*Game Master rolls d20 + situation modifier or opponent's attribute*  
**Example:** d20=15 + Danger(+3) = Difficulty 18

**Purpose**: Determine how difficult the challenge is.

---

### 3. 🎲 **ACTION**  
*Player rolls d20 + attribute*  
**Example:** d20=10 + Strength(+3) + Assistance(+2) = 15

**🤝 Assistance:** another player adds their attribute to the roll

- ✅ **SUCCESS** (roll is greater than or equal to difficulty) — victory!  
- ❌ **FAILURE** — begins **TENSION**

---

### 4. ⏳ **TENSION**  
*The hero has 5 rounds or 5 lives, depending on the situation.
Player rolls d4:*

| d4  | Result       | Difficulty | Rounds |
| --- | ------------ | ---------- | ------ |
| 1   | 💥 Getting Worse | +3        | -3     |
| 2   | 🔥 Hard      | -1        | -2     |
| 3   | ⚔️ Perseverance | -2        | -1     |
| 4   | 🎯 Breakthrough | -3        | -0     |

**DEFEAT:** if rounds are less than or equal to 0 — complete failure

*Improvise! Don't feel constrained by the number of rounds. Shorten them, interrupt them to introduce a new event or action. The main thing is that it's interesting and logical for your story.*

### 💡 EXAMPLE

*"The hero is cracking a safe"*  
1. **Situation:** d4=1 (💀 Danger +3)  
2. **Difficulty:** d20=10 + 3 = 13  
3. **Action:** player rolls 8 + Intellect(+2) = 10 (failure!)  
4. **Tension:** d4=1 — difficulty 16, 2 rounds left  
*"You triggered the alarm! Sirens are blaring, there's little time left"*

---

## 🌀 **PLOT TWIST**
*Use after key scenes to make the story develop unexpectedly*

| d4  | Twist            |
| --- | ---------------- |
| 1   | 🔄 Setback       |
| 2   | ⏸️ Dead End      |
| 3   | 🌱 Fork/Clue     |
| 4   | 🎯 Progress      |

## ⚔️ Player vs Player (PVP)

- 🎲 **Attacker** sets difficulty: `d20 + their attribute`  
- 🛡️ **Defender** rolls: `d20 + their attribute`  
- ✅ **Successful defense** = blocked the attack, can now counter-attack  
- ❌ **Failed defense** = begins ⏳ Tension (5 rounds)  
- 🔁 **Each round** attacker rerolls difficulty and sums buffs/debuffs from defender's Tension  

### 🎭 Conflict Example

- ROUND 1 - Studying Style
	🎲 Attacker: d20=14 + 💪Strength(+2) = difficulty 16  
	🛡️ Defense: d20=9 + 🎯Dexterity(+1) = 10 ❌ FAILURE  
	⏳ Tension: d4=3 → difficulty -2 (you studied their movement style), -1 round or life  

- ROUND 2 - Using Knowledge  
	🎲 Attacker: d20=12 + 💪Strength(+2) = difficulty 14 (-2 = 12)  
	🛡️ Defense: d20=15 + 🎯Dexterity(+1) = 16 ✅ SUCCESS!  
	💬 "Using knowledge of their style, you parry the blow and counterattack!"  

- ROUND 3 - Opponent Adapts
	🎲 New attacker: d20=10 + 🎯Dexterity(+1) = difficulty 11  
	🛡️ New defense: d20=6 + 💪Strength(+2) = 8 ❌ FAILURE  
	⏳ Tension: d4=4 → difficulty -3 (opponent studied your techniques)
