## 🚀 DEPTH AND PROGRESS

_For groups that want more tactical depth and a sense of progression in a long-term campaign._

### Skills and Proficiency

Your biography is still important, but now your key abilities are outlined in a skills table. Your description now provides a maximum bonus of +1, but retains the impact of weaknesses, up to -4.

#### Creating Skills

Compile a list of skills that define your character.

A skill is a specific area in which you excel: "Bladed Weapons," "Stealth," "Fire Magic," "Persuasion."

Each skill is assigned a **Proficiency** value—this is the bonus you add to rolls related to that skill.

During character creation:
- Most of your skills have a Proficiency of 1.
- One skill (your main one) has a Proficiency of 2.

#### Improving Skills

After successfully overcoming a significant challenge where a skill was critical, or after undergoing extensive training, the Master may allow you to increase that skill's Proficiency by 1.

**Important:** If you go a long time without using a skill (e.g., several sessions in a row without being in situations that require it), its Proficiency may decrease to a minimum of 1. This reflects a loss of practice.

### Limitations via Condition Tracks

Use Condition Tracks to manage special abilities and resources (mana, stamina, concentration).

Create tracks that suit your setting and character concept: "Mana," "Stamina," "Mental Fortitude."

Using special abilities may require expending points on these tracks. For example, casting a spell might require filling 1 box on the "Mana" track.
Costs are paid without a roll—you simply pay the price.

Also, the number of boxes on these tracks can increase with improvements in skill Proficiency.

### Creating Special Abilities

You can create unique abilities for your character.
- **Description:** Describe what the ability does and how it works within the world.
- **Requirements:** Set a minimum Proficiency value for the corresponding skill.
- **Cost:** Specify how many boxes and from which Condition Tracks must be expended to use the ability.

_Example:_
> **Fireball**
> - _Description:_ You create and hurl a sphere of fire that damages enemies.
> - _Requirements:_ Proficiency in the "Fire Magic" skill of at least 3.
> - _Cost:_ 1 box on the "Mana" track.

### The Impact of Skills on the Game
Skills and special abilities can influence the game in various ways:
- **Bonuses to Rolls:** The primary use—adding your Proficiency bonus to a d20 roll.
- **Narrative Permission:** A skill can grant you the right to an automatic success in simple situations or the ability to attempt things that would be impossible without the skill.
- **Rounds:** Some abilities can increase or decrease the number of rounds in a Tension scene (for you or your opponent).
- **Opponent's Condition Tracks:** Abilities may allow you to immediately fill boxes on an opponent's Condition Tracks (e.g., "Fear" or "Injuries").
- ... In general, they can influence anything; the main thing is to balance them.

### Equipment

Equipment can now provide permanent or situational bonuses.
- **Armor:** Provides a bonus to defense (e.g., +1 to the difficulty for opponents attacking you).
- **Weapons:** Provides a bonus to attack (e.g., +1 to an attack roll).
- **Artifacts:** Can grant special abilities or skill bonuses.

_Example:_
> **Steel Sword:** Grants +1 to an attack roll if you have the "Bladed Weapons" skill.
> **Cloak of Shadows:** Once per scene, allows you to reroll a die on a Stealth check.

### Important Note

These rules are tools. Use them as needed. Don't let them overshadow the story. The numbers are recommendations, but you can adjust them to suit your game's pace and style.
